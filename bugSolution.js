/* Solution for Gradient Issues */
// Ensure sufficient color contrast between 'from' and 'to' colors in the gradient.
// Consider using a more robust approach like CSS gradients directly for better browser support if necessary.

/* Solution for @apply Directive Issues */
// Ensure that styles applied via @apply do not conflict.
// Consider using more specific selectors or separating styles into different layers to avoid conflicts.
// Check for any errors in your Tailwind configuration, especially related to plugins or custom styles.
